## Hi there 👋

Welcome to Cartheur Research!

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - We develop novel hardware and software leading to ideal computing devices that have a _managed_ Ai through how we leverage ML.

🌈 Contribution guidelines - If you would like to get involved, send us a contact message.

👩‍💻 Useful resources - We focus our efforts on innovating with the _x09_ architecture. You can find these resources in the @cartheur github repository presently.

🍿 Fun facts - We started in 2022 but our development history, experience, and knowledge stretches back to 1979. This is far more relevant than you can imagine.

🧙 We are here to help artificial intelligence and human-necessary processes be integrated for maximum benefit and not for a dystopian vision.
